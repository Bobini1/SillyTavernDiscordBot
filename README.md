# SillyTavernDiscordBot
## How to run
Rename .env.example to .env and add the API token of your Discord bot (https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Change the `CHARACTER_NAME` to the character you want to chat with. The Discord bot will react to this name.

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will also need to install a Chrome Selenium driver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started).

Then simply run `python main.py`
